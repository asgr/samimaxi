This is for the preparation of ideal SAMI tiles to be sent to Michael Goodwin (MG from here) for final processing and plate drilling etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GETTING STARTED

Once you have R installed (google "R project") you need to install 4 packages. To do this type:

> R

...wait for R to load... then:

> install.packages('fields',dependencies=T)
> install.packages('sphereplot',dependencies=T)
> install.packages('magicaxis',dependencies=T)
> install.packages('plotrix',dependencies=T)

You might need to select a file server from a list, just choose a nearby one.

Once you've done that you should exit R by typing:

> q()

Assuming you're reading this document, you've presumably downloaded the Maxi code too. At this stage it would be helpful to rename the top level folder of the downloaded code to 'Maxi' (github might name it something else automatically) since I use this in later parts of the instructions.

cd to the directory 'Maxi' and do:

> chmod a+x RUNME.r

Now you should be able to type:

> ./RUNME.r samitargets.dat guide.dat specst.dat g09 10

This will populate the folder SAMIG09T1-10 with Target & Guide .fld files (to be passed to MG), a .info file (Useful summary info on the tile produced) and a .r file (an R readable output from the tiling code, can be used for debugging). It also generates a number of plots to summarise the results of the tiling. !!!(This won't work on the GitHub version of the code because I didn't want to make SAMI data fully public!)!!!

The arguments you input correspond to:

> ./RUNME.r inputtargetfile guidefile specstandardsfile region NumberOfTilesToMake

region can currently take the options g09 g12 g15, and specifies the GAMA region you want to produce SAMI tiles for.
NumberOfTilesToMake should be an integer of 1 or more, and specifies the number of tiles you would like to produce. If survey completes before this is achieved the software will stop.

RUNME is a top level wrapper. To start looking around the code you can type:

> R
> source('sourceall.rscript')
> samitile
> besttile

These two functions do most of the "work". "besttile" does everything required to generate the next best tile, "samitile" invokes this repeatally to generate the survey, whilst piecing together the outputs of "besttile" in the most suitable manner. Again, if you want to quit and get back to the normal terminal (where you'll run the scripts) just type:

> q()

-------------------------

Meaning of isel in output tile files:

Even values only occur when object meets the conditions of N+1 (high priority odd flag), but it is outside the first Nfillin targets in the output tile file. So you might get 12 isel=9 and 5 isel=8 clustered objects within the SAMI FoV in an output tile file.

isel	Description
9 	Clustered top priority SAMI main survey targets with 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre (these are objects that are colliding with other targets within 229'', so should be removed ASAP).
8 	Clustered top priority SAMI main survey targets with 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre, but outside the first 12 targets (so probably won't be targeted).
7 	Unclustered top priority SAMI main survey targets with 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre.
6 	Unclustered top priority SAMI main survey targets with 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre, but outside the first 12 targets (so probably won't be targeted).
5 	Filler SAMI targets within 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre.
4 	Filler SAMI targets within 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the proposed tile centre, but outside the first 12 targets (so probably won't be targeted).
2 	Top priority SAMI main survey targets with 0.5 < r < 1 deg of the proposed tile centre.
0 	Filler SAMI targets within 0.5 < r < 1 deg of the proposed tile centre.

Spectra isel equals inputpri+10 for standards in the outer region and inputpri+10+max(inputpri)+1 in the inner region. This ensures that all inner region (SAMI FoV) standards are higher priority than all outer region standards. In practice it is hoped only inner region standards are ever used.

Tiles/Guides... tile file:

isel	Description
9 	The massively preferred SAMI guides.
7 	The next best guide options. These guides cover the desired 12 best targets with the 0.5 deg SAMI FoV.
5 	Other guides within 0 < r < 0.5 deg of the preferred tile centre.
3 	Other guides within 0.5 < r < 1 deg of the preferred tile centre.
